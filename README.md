My 'Hello World' program

Hi there.  If you've found this document, you've probably made a mistake somewhere.  My name is Caleb and at the time of this writing, I'm 27 years old.  I'm interested in application software and game development and am currently working towards learning C++, Java, and Python.  I have limited experience with Javascript and general web design practices (I'm especially fond of CSS3), although web design isn't exactly my forte.  Anyway, if you read any of this, it's nice to meet you.  I look forward to working with you all very soon.
